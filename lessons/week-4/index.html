                <div class="col-xs-8">
                    <h2>Coin combinations</h2>
                    <p>Have you noticed those coin slides used by modern cash registers that automatically give the correct amount of change? Build a website lets users enter an amount of cents and shows the least amount of coins needed to make that change. For bonus points, show more than one combination. Start with tests for small combinations and work up from there.</p>
                    <h2>Word Order</h2>
                    <p>Let&#39;s create a webpage that lets users input a block of text and returns a list of all the unique words, ordered by number of appearances.</p>
                    <p>For example, if the user inputs
                    &quot;hello world world&quot;, the page should show:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>world</li>
                    <li>hello</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For words that appear the same amount of times, order by which word appeared first.</p>
                    <h2>Next Weekday</h2>
                    <p>Make a webpage that allows users to input a day of the week (like Friday) and return the date of the next occurrence (like 7/11/2014). If a user enters the current day, it should return the date of a week from today - not today.</p>
                    <p>We can get the current date by writing <code class="prettyprint">var today = new Date</code>. We can then get the current month using <code class="prettyprint">today.getMonth()</code> or day with <code class="prettyprint">today.getDay()</code>. There are many more ways you can get information about (and even change) dates. Check out the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date">MDN documentation</a> on Date.</p>
                    <h2>Weekdays in Month</h2>
                    <p>This function should take a weekday and a month as an argument (&quot;Friday&quot;, &quot;January&quot;) and return all the dates of that weekday in the given month. You can add this function to the previous webpage. </p>

                <div class="col-xs-8">
                    <p>Ready for something a little harder? Write a Pig Latin translator. Here are the rules of Pig Latin:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>For words that start with a vowel, add &quot;ay&quot; to the end.</li>
                    <li>For words that start with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end and add &quot;ay&quot;. (If the first consonants include &quot;qu&quot;, move the &quot;u&quot; along with the &quot;q&quot;. Don&#39;t forget about words like &quot;squeal&quot; where the &quot;qu&quot; doesn&#39;t come first!)</li>
                    <li>For words that start with &quot;y&quot;, treat the &quot;y&quot; as a consonant.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Remember to break this down into small tests. When you get to consonants, don&#39;t try to solve it all at once. Instead, start with an example of a word that only has one consonant; then a word with two consonants; then a word with three; and then tackle &quot;qu&quot; and &quot;y&quot;.</p>
                    <p>The <code class="prettyprint">.slice()</code> method for strings may come in handy.</p>
                    <p>Once you have it working for one word, get it working for sentences.</p>
                    <p>And if you finish all of this, read about <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions">regular expressions</a> and refactor your code to use them.</p>

                <h2>JavaScript BDD Evaluation</h2>
                <div class="col-xs-8">
                    <p>Starting here, at the end of every section, there will be an assessment for you to take. These assessments are designed to help you gauge if you&#39;re ready to move on to the next section. </p>
                    <p>These assessments will test that you understand the concepts from the section, and can you write good code using them - that simple. Programmers don&#39;t write new apps in isolation, and frequently reference code they&#39;ve written and resources they&#39;ve used; so reviewing your past code, and lessons from this and other sites, searching Google, and looking on Stack Overflow are all allowed. However, you should complete these assessments on your own, without asking for help from others (including asking a question on Stack Overflow), so that you can make sure you understand the concepts .</p>
                    <p>For this section, your assessment is to simply write a function in JavaScript, using BDD to guide your implementation. You can make up your own idea of something to build, or you can work on an exercise from the past section that you didn&#39;t get to earlier.</p>
                    <p>Please include a README file (simple text, explaining the purpose and background of the function)</p>
                    <p>When you finish, submit a link to your project on GitHub in your class Slack room. Your teachers will evaluate it based on the following criteria:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Does the function work?</li>
                    <li>Do you have complete spec coverage?</li>
                    <li>Do your specs have clear English descriptions?</li>
                    <li>Is your logic easy to understand?</li>
                    <li>Did you use descriptive variable names?</li>
                    <li>Does your code have proper indentation and spacing?</li>
                    <li>Did you include a README with a background information and your name?</li>
                    <li>Is the project tracked in Git, and did you regularly make commits with clear messages?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For each of these, your teachers will choose one of the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>The code does not meet this standard.</li>
                    <li>The code meets this standard most of the time.</li>
                    <li>The code meets this standard all of the time.</li>
                    <li>The code exceeds this standard.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If your code meets all of the standards most of the time or better, then you are ready to move to the next section! If not, you should spend some more time practicing this section, and then submit another evaluation.</p>
                    <p>I&#39;d <strong>strongly</strong> recommend you grade yourself before turning in your assessment. Better yet, wait at least an hour after you finish, then come back and grade yourself. You&#39;ll catch many things you didn&#39;t notice as you were coding.</p>
