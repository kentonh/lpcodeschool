<h2>MONDAY TUESDAY</h2>
<h3>Branching practice</h3>
<p>Now, make a couple web pages incorporating branching:</p>
<ul>
<li>A page with information about turtles, snakes, and insects that asks you which animal you&#39;d like to learn about.</li>
<li>A page with information about voting that displays different information to minors.</li>
<li>A page for an amusement park that only shows you information on rides that you&#39;re tall enough to go on.</li>
</ul>

<h2>MONDAY TUESDAY</h2>
<h3>More branching practice</h3>
<p>Here are some web pages for you to build to practice your branching skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>A celebrity dating webpage, where you enter information about yourself, and the page suggests which celebrity you should date.</li>
<li>A political beliefs meter that asks you questions about your values and tells you how liberal or conservative you are.</li>
<li>Code to check for fields left blank on these pages. If you&#39;re checking multiple fields, don&#39;t just pop up a dialog box for each one - that would be annoying. Instead, add some text by the field that needs to be fixed. Bootstrap has some nice styles for this - check out their <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms">form documentation</a>, in the last section titled <em>Validation states</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>MONDAY TUESDAY</h2>
<h3>Arrays practice</h3>
<p>Play around with arrays of your own:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make an array of your siblings&#39; names. </li>
<li>Make an array of your parents&#39; names.</li>
<li>Combine the two arrays using <code class="prettyprint">concat()</code>.</li>
<li>Add your pets&#39; names using <code class="prettyprint">push()</code>.</li>
<li>Reverse the order of the array.</li>
<li>Access one of your parents&#39; names using the square bracket notation.</li>
<li>Check out methods from the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/prototype#Methods (stick to the accessor and mutator methods sections). Try at least five of them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>WEDNESDAY TUESDAY</h2>
<h3>Looping practice</h3>
<p>Looping can be tricky, so you should practice it until you feel comfortable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make an array of your friends&#39; names, then loop through it and <code class="prettyprint">alert()</code> a hello to each of them.</li>
<li>Make a web page that lists out your favorite ice cream flavors. Rather than writing the flavors in the HTML, use a JavaScript loop to insert the flavors into the page from an array.</li>
<li>Write a loop to multiply an arbitrary amount of numbers. This should look very similar to the code to sum numbers from the lesson.</li>
<li>Refactor your Mad Libs page to use a loop.</li>
<li>Go back to your page where it would pop up an alert every time you clicked an element and say what kind of tag it was. Refactor your JavaScript for this page to use a loop.</li>
</ul>

<h2>WEDNESDAY TUESDAY</h2>
<h3>for loop practice</h3>
<p>Here are a couple exercises for you to get some practice with <code class="prettyprint">for</code> loops:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go back through the <a href="http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/looping-practice">looping practice</a> problems, and redo them all with <code class="prettyprint">for</code> loops.</li>
<li>Make a web page that prints out the lyrics to &quot;99 bottles of beer on the wall&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FRIDAY THURSDAY</h2>
<h3>BDD branching exercises: leap year, queen attack, triangle</h3>
<h2>Leap year</h2>
<p>Here&#39;s your first assignment for class:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow along with the leap year lesson, building the app with the guidance of the lesson.</li>
<li>There&#39;s one final rule for leap years: if a year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year. Write a test, make it pass, then refactor your code.</li>
<li>There&#39;s a bug in the code! If you enter a year that isn&#39;t a leap year, and then enter a year that is, it incorrectly tells you that that the year is not a leap year. Fix this bug.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don&#39;t worry about finishing all of the exercises on this page! People come to Epicodus with different levels of experience and different speeds of learning, and you should go at the pace that&#39;s right for you. It&#39;s better to really understand what you&#39;re working on than try to rush through anything. If you don&#39;t finish all the exercises today, no need to do them for homework. We&#39;re all going to start with new exercises tomorrow - the idea is that we cover the same <em>breadth</em> of knowledge, but there are enough exercises that everybody can go to different <em>depths</em>.</p>
<h2>Queen attack</h2>
<p>If you finish the leap year project, here&#39;s another one for you. In chess, a queen can move horizontally, vertically, and diagonally, making it the most powerful piece on the board. If another piece is within its line of sight, the queen can attack it. We&#39;re going to make a page that lets the user choose two positions on a chess board, and tell whether a queen can attack one position from the other.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s your first test:</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint javascript">describe(&#39;queenAttack&#39;, function() {
  it(&#39;is false if the coordinates are not horizontally, vertically, or diagonally in line with each other&#39;, function() {
    queenAttack([1, 1], [2, 3]).should.equal(false);
  });
});
</code></pre>
<p>After you make that one pass, write a spec for a queen attacking horizontally, and get it to pass; then one for vertically, and get it to pass; and finally one for diagonally. Remember to refactor if appropriate. Don&#39;t be tempted to write a singe test for the <code class="prettyprint">true</code> case (e.g., it &#39;is true if it can attack horizontally or vertically or diagonally&#39;) - there are three separate behaviors here for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal.</p>
<p>Once you have the <code class="prettyprint">queenAttack()</code> function working, create a web page where users can enter sets of coordinate and find out if a queen can attack from them.</p>
<h2>Triangle</h2>
<p>Okay, here&#39;s one more, if you get through the other two and have time left in your day. Make a web page that lets the user input the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and tells whether they form an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle. If you&#39;re not familiar with these terms, here are definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>equilateral: all sides are equal;</li>
<li>isosceles: exactly 2 sides are equal;</li>
<li>scalene: no sides are equal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that not all combinations of three numbers make valid triangles. For example, (2, 2, 8) does not make a triangle. The general rule is that if one side is at least as long as the other two combined, the lengths do not form a triangle.</p>

<h3>BDD looping exercises: title case, anagram</h3>
<h2>Title case</h2>
<p>Make a web page where a user can input a name and it converts it to title case (the first letter of each word capitalized). There are a lot of rules to title casing - think about words like <em>the</em> and <em>and</em>.</p>
<p>Remember to start off simple. I like to pick the simplest possible behavior and write a spec for it, make it pass, and then pick the next simplest behavior. Here, I might start with a one-word title, and then return it back with the first letter capitalized. Next, I might write a spec for a one-word title that&#39;s all lower-case, and return back in title case. And so on.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a way to think about your specs. When you get to the <code class="prettyprint">it()</code> function, you should be answering the question &quot;What does this code do?&quot; The behavior for your first spec might read something like, <code class="prettyprint">it(&quot;capitalizes the first letter of a word&quot;)</code>. Here&#39;s the first spec written out for you:</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint javascript">describe(&quot;titleCase&quot;, function() {
  it(&quot;capitalizes the first letter of a word&quot;, function() {
    titleCase(&quot;cat&quot;).should.equal(&quot;Cat&quot;);
  });
});
</code></pre>
<p>By the time you finish, make sure your code can handle inputs in all lowercase, all uppercase, a mix of different cases, one word, multiple words, and anything else you can think of.</p>
<h3>Comparing arrays</h3>
<p>At some point today, you might run into the need to compare two arrays in a test. Here&#39;s a trivial example:</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint javascript">it(&#39;is the same array&#39;, function() {
  [1, 2, 3].should.equal([1, 2, 3]);
});
</code></pre>
<p>This test will fail! Here&#39;s why. In JavaScript, primitives are the same: for example, &quot;abc&quot; is the same as any other &quot;abc&quot;. But arrays are different - no two arrays are the same, even if they have the same elements inside. So, we need to tell JavaScript not to compare the two arrays themselves, but rather to look through them and see if all of the elements inside are the same. In our testing, we do it with the <code class="prettyprint">eql()</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint javascript">it(&#39;is the same array&#39;, function() {
  [1, 2, 3].should.eql([1, 2, 3]);
});
</code></pre>
<h2>Anagram</h2>
<p>Write a web page where a user can input a single word, and a list of other words that may be anagrams. After submitting the form, the user should be told which of the list of words were anagrams.</p>
<p>The <code class="prettyprint">.sort()</code> method on arrays may come in handy.</p>
<p>If you finish this, modify your function to handle partial matches - in other words, <em>hat</em> should match <em>path</em>.</p>
