                <h2>How to ask for help.</h2>
                <div class="col-xs-8 embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3">
					<p>Throughout your programing career, and especially while you&#39;re just starting out learning, you&#39;re going to need help from other people. If you follow these guidelines, you&#39;ll find that you&#39;ll be able to get help much more quickly.</p>
					<ol>
					<li><strong>Do your own research.</strong> Go through all of the steps on the <a href="http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/debugging-in-javascript">debugging lessons</a> before asking for help. Re-read/watch the relevant lessons on this site. Search online to see if you can find anybody else you had the same problem you did.</li>
					<li><strong>Have your problem as close to being fixed as you know how.</strong> Often, when something isn&#39;t going right, you try a lot of different things to see what works, including things you think won&#39;t work but want to try out. Before you ask someone for help, get your project back to the state that you think is the closest to working. </li>
					<li><strong>Demonstrate the problem.</strong> It can be tempting to show the person helping you the problematic code and explain all the things you tried, but without the context of seeing what&#39;s going wrong, it will be hard to understand what you&#39;re talking about. Demonstrate the bug, show the part of the program you can&#39;t figure how to make work, pull up the error message.</li>
					<li><strong>Narrow down the problem.</strong> Show which part of the code you think is the culprit. Explain why you think your code in the present state should work, and any ideas you have about why it doesn&#39;t.</li>
					<li><strong>Share your hypotheses.</strong> Often, you&#39;ll have some ideas about what&#39;s going wrong based on your understand and clues from your research. Share these with the person helping you, as they may not be immediately obvious.</li>

                <p>A common mistake I see new programmers make is to mix up their <em>user interface logic</em> with their <em>program logic</em>. After watching the video or reading the text, notice how our <code class="prettyprint">leapYear</code> function doesn&#39;t do anything that involves user interaction; all of that is grouped together in the <code class="prettyprint">$(document).ready()</code> callback. In your own code, you should strive to have this clean separation as well.</p>
                <p>Remember to put a space between your <code class="prettyprint">it</code>s to make your specs easier to read.</p>

                <h2>Pair programming</h2>
                <div class="col-xs-8 embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3">
					<p>During class, we may practice <strong>pair programming</strong>, where two people use the same computer at the same time. One person <strong>drives</strong>, controlling the keyboard and mouse, and the other person watches and talks. There are several reasons why pair programming can be more effective than <strong>soloing</strong>:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>Programming is less about writing massive amounts of code and more about solving difficult problems. When two people solve a problem together, you often come up with better solutions, more quickly than each working alone.</li>
					<li>Usually, each person in a pair will have different knowledge and different strengths. Pairing lets you learn from each other.</li>
					<li>When you work alone, you&#39;re often tempted to take shortcuts that will come back to haunt you - such as writing your code without tests. When pairing, you can hold each other accountable to writing high-quality code.</li>
					<li>When you watch somebody else code, it&#39;s easier for you to see their mistakes and catch their bugs than for them to see their own.</li>
					<li>You don&#39;t check your email, social networks, news, text messages, and so on when you&#39;re pairing; as a result, you&#39;re much more productive.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>During class, you&#39;ll generally use <strong>ping-pong pairing</strong>. In ping-pong, one person writes a test, and then the other person writes the code to make the test pass. Then that person writes the next test, and the first person writes the code. And so on.</p>
					<p>If you&#39;re working on a really tricky problem, you may find that it takes a while to figure out how to get a test to pass. In that case, switch drivers after about fifteen minutes if it doesn&#39;t look like you&#39;re going to finish soon. Or, if you&#39;re working on something that isn&#39;t tested, like your CSS, also switch every fifteen minutes. If you&#39;re driving, keep an eye on the clock - you&#39;ll be amazed at how fast time flies, so make sure you aren&#39;t accidentally a keyboard hog.</p>
					<p>Even though pairing has many advantages, it can be frustrating at times. You&#39;ll usually be working with someone who is either more or less experienced than you, and you&#39;ll often feel like you&#39;re slowing down your pair, or they&#39;re slowing you down. You might want to explore how something works, while your pair wants to focus on actually finishing the project at hand. You&#39;ll run into a nasty bug, and you&#39;ll have different ideas about the right way to try to fix it.</p>
					<p>Some of the best advice I&#39;ve read on how to deal with these problems comes from <a href="http://www.zeespencer.com/">Zee Spencer</a> on <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/2013/04/08/are-you-a-chef-or-the-kool-aid-man-making-the-most-of-pair-programming/">Dev Bootcamp&#39;s blog</a> (they&#39;re another code school). Here&#39;s an excerpt:</p>
					<blockquote>
					<p>A common theme from todays assessments is <strong>pairing is really hard.</strong> While everyone loved it they all shared a couple insecurities: <strong>I feel bad when I&#39;m slowing people down,</strong> and <strong>I feel bad when I leave people behind.</strong> Many even <strong>shared both insecurities.</strong></p>
					<p>This is normal. Why? Because you are <strong>discovering your separate talents.</strong> Some of you are power-sluggers who burst through challenges like the kool-aid man. Some of you are food-scientists, experimenting with each challenge until you deeply understand its nutritional value. Others are chefs. Completing a challenge, then spending time ensuring it is prepared beautifully, clearly and effectively. All of you are smart, hard working, and talented.</p>
					<p><strong>Why is pairing so hard? Because you each have different expertise, interests, and backgrounds.</strong> Not to mention different communication and learning styles! It requires the kool-aid man and the chef to make a dish together.</p>
					<p>This actually a huge benefit of pairing, because <strong>pairing brings balance, and balance brings learning.</strong> Here are some helpful tips to guide you to pairing bliss:</p>
					<p><strong>1. Prefix the pairing session by setting expectations.</strong> It&#39;s easy to assume that everyone you&#39;re pairing with has the same expectations for the pairing session. This is not always the case! I often want to blow through the tasks at hand as quickly as possible; but my pair wants to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying themes or part of the codebase. As you can imagine, these differing expectations cause conflict! Make sure you&#39;re both on the same page before you start coding; and you&#39;ll save hours of frustration.</p>
					<p><strong>2. Identify your natural inclination.</strong> If your pair knows your tendencies, they&#39;ll be more likely to adapt their pairing style to fit your tendencies, and vice versa. Don&#39;t be afraid to say &quot;Hey, I really like to understand what&#39;s happening or I start to panic&quot; or &quot;I can&#39;t stand sitting still for too long or I start to freak out.&quot; Both are reasonable! Find the balance between them!</p>
					<p><strong>3. Ask for the keyboard.</strong> Time and again I&#39;ve let my pair who knew what was going on race ahead of me as I got really good at Angry Birds. If you get left behind ask for the keyboard. This helps you understand what is going on because you&#39;re listening and typing; and it helps your pair understand and communicate things better because they have to express their code-desires in words at least one other person can understand.</p>
					<p><strong>4. Speak up when you&#39;re uncomfortable.</strong> Time and again I&#39;ve caused my pair to wither to a shadow of their former self. I make a snide comment or I looked at them like they were an idiot. If I knew how bad I made them feel I would change my behavior in a heartbeat. Feelings are legit. Expose them when bruised. Saying &quot;Hey, that hurt&quot; is often all it takes. If you need backup, talk to me or another teacher.</p>

					<p>Every class, before you start programming, we&#39;ll ask you and your pair to check in with each other. Take Zee&#39;s advice and talk about what your personal goals are, and to learn what your pair&#39;s goals are. Share your strengths and weaknesses - both in programming and in pairing. Tell your pair what you need to be happy and work well, and ask them to support you. Ask them what they need.</p>
					<p>At the end of each day, you&#39;ll finish by telling your pair what you liked about working with them, and you&#39;ll ask them what you can do to be a better pair to them next time. If you&#39;re had a tough time pairing with somebody, pick just one thing you&#39;d like them to do differently - if you give them a litany, it&#39;ll be harder for them to change than if you tell them just one thing.</p>
					<p>When you&#39;re studying at home by yourself, or if your pair is absent and you&#39;re soloing, here are a couple tips to help you get by:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>Regularly explain what you&#39;re learning to somebody else. Show them your code and explain what it does - that process will help you better understand what you&#39;ve done and even improve it.</li>
					<li>If you get stuck, one of the most powerful tricks is called <em>rubber-ducky debugging</em>: put a rubber ducky on your desk, and when you have a problem, explain the problem out loud to your ducky, as if you were asking another person for help. Even when experienced programmers ask each other for help, they often find that they answer their own question in the process of formulating it for another person. Asking the rubber ducky is just a way of going through that same externalization process.</li>
					</ul>
