<h2>MONDAY TUESDAY</h2>

<h3>Arithmetic practice</h3>
<p>Here are some exercises for you to practice arithmetic in JavaScript:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add, subtract, multiply, and divide some numbers.</li>
<li>Find the remainder of dividing two numbers by using the modulo operator.</li>
<li>Divide a number by 0.</li>
<li>Divide 0 by 0.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="span12">
<h3>Variables practice</h3>
<p>Here are a few exercises for you to practice using variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set a variable called favoriteNumber equal to your favorite number.</li>
<li>Calculate what your favorite number divided by 2 is.</li>
<li>Set another variable called michaelsFavorite equal to 13.</li>
<li>Change the value of michaelsFavorite to 7.</li>
<li>Subtract your favorite number from mine.</li>
<li>Change the value of my favorite number to be 26 times its current value.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="span12">
<h3>Methods practice</h3>
<p>Practice using the methods you've learned about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Convert a number to exponential notation.</li>
<li>Convert it back.</li>
<li>Specify the number of decimals it should have.</li>
<li>Repeat all of these using a variable set equal to a number.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="span12">
<h3>Strings Practice</h3>
<p>Practice using strings:</p>
<ul>
<li >Type a greeting to your best friend.</li>
<li>Set a variable equal to a string.</li>
<li>Call a method on that variable.</li>
<li>Make sure you're clear on the difference between "9" with quotes and 9 without.</li>
<li>Check out the MDN's documentation of string methods ( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/prototype#Methods ) and try out at least five yourself. If some of them don't make sense, don't worry about it - just try the ones that do. (Stick to the section labelled Methods unrelated to HTML.)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="span12">
Functions practice
Practice using JavaScript functions:

Use alert() to pop up a dialog box.
Use confirm() to ask a yes or no question.
Use prompt() to ask a question.
Save the response to the prompt() as a variable, and then run a string method of your choice on it.
</div>
<div class="span12">

<h3>Practice writing functions</h3>
Write functions of your own to:
<ul>
take somebody's name and say a greeting to them;
subtract two numbers;
multiply two numbers;
divide two numbers.
Use the example of how to add two numbers from the previous lesson as a reference.
</ul>
</div>
<div class="span12">

<h2>WEDNESDAY</h2>

<h3>jQuery practice</h3>
<ul>
<li >Make your own version of the html-help.html page. <a href="7-intro-to-jQuery">found here</a></li>
<li>Add an <code class="prettyprint"><pre>&lt;h2></pre></code> and bind an event handler to it with <code class="prettyprint">.click()</code>. Pass in a callback that contains an <code class="prettyprint">alert()</code>.</li>
<li>Do the same for a <code class="prettyprint">&lt;ul></code>.</li>
<li>Swap out the <code class="prettyprint">.click()</code> method for <code class="prettyprint">.dblclick()</code> and <code class="prettyprint">.hover()</code> in a couple places.</li>
</div>

<div class="span12">

<h2>THURSDAY</h2>

<h3>jQuery effects practice</h3>
Let's get some practice using jQuery effects.
<ul>
<li>Make a homepage for your cat if you haven't already. Add some text that alternates between saying "Hide/show images", and toggles the images appropriately.</li>
<li>Make a "vacation" page, make a few of the sections hidden by default, with a bit of teaser text that expands when you click on it (e.g., "Click to learn about the giant sandcastles of this fabulous country!").</li>
<li>On any pages of your choosing, try fading and sliding elements with .fadeIn(), .fadeOut(), .fadeToggle(), .slideDown(), .slideUp(), and .slideToggle().</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="span12">
<h2>FRIDAY</h2>

<h3>Manipulation and traversal practice</h3>
Okay, your turn. Practice adding some interactivity to your web pages:
<ul>
<li>Continue on from the talk.html page from the last lesson. I only added the deleting functionality to one of the buttons. Now, you add it to the other ones.</li>
<li>Add a feature so that each message has an "x" next to it. When you click the "x", it should delete the line.</li>
<li>Make a "cat vs dog" page - if you click a button for the cat to meow, the dog should bark back, and vis versa. Include the same deleting functionality as in talk.html (but re-write the code yourself!).</li>
<li >Extra credit: Have you noticed how there's a lot of repetition in you JavaScript? On talk.html, there's three sections that select a button, attach a click event listener, and pass a callback that looks the same except for the message. The only things that differ among them are the ID of the button and the message. Eliminate this repetition by creating a function that accepts two arguments for the ID and the message, and then finds the appropriate button and binds a callback with the appropriate message.</li>
</div>
<div class="span12">

<h3>Forms practice</h3>
Okay, now it's your turn.
<ul>
<li>Make a Mad Libs of your own.</li>
<li>Make a form letter where the user inputs their name, and they get back a letter addressed to them.</li>
<li>Create a page that asks the user to type something into a field, and when they submit the form, have the page say it back to them in all uppercase.</li>
</div>
<div class="span12">
<h3>jQuery attributes practice</h3>
Here are some exercises for you to practice using jQuery:
<ul>
<li>Most people like dark text on a light background, but some people prefer light text on a dark background. Update one of your pages to include a button that lets your users switch to light on dark.</li>
<li>Now, update this page so that users can switch back to the original color scheme.</li>
<li>Update your boring lecture page so that when somebody clicks on a paragraph, it highlights it and adds a box around the edges.</li>
</ul>
